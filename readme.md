This is a task-manager api
A user can create in-memory CRUD for tasks. 

The .env contains - shared just for info purpose
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

Have used JOI for validation purpose. Also to mention the project brief is incomplete without any clarity to build things.
This is mostly built using the testcases.

Project Brief - 
In this guided project, you'll build a RESTful API for managing tasks using Node.js, Express.js, and in-memory data storage. You'll implement CRUD operations, error handling, and input validation, and test the API using Postman or curl.

By completing each step thoroughly, you’ll gain a solid understanding of building APIs with Express.js, enhancing your skills in error handling, validation, and filtering.

Remember, the goal is to create a functional, well-structured API. Focus on understanding the concepts and implementing them in your own way. If you get stuck, try to break down the problem and solve it step by step. Good luck!
